# Context7 Integration Rule

You have access to the "context7" MCP server.
**ALWAYS** use the "context7" tools to fetch the latest documentation and library usage examples BEFORE writing code or answering technical questions.
Do not ask for permission to check docs; just do it automatically to ensure the code is up-to-date.
